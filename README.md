# Email-Hunter
This app alllows you to type in the URL of a website and see all the publicly available email addresses associated to that organisation. the front end and business logic are seperated so if you connect a database and feed the program lists of URLs it can be used to create mailing lists.

NOTE:

Some parts of the code have been commented out because they connect to my MongoDB.

The Requests library will need to be installed.

Run the application from the 'main.pyw' file.
